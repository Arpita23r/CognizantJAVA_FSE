Time Complexity:

Linear Search: O(n)
Binary Search: O(log n)


Linear Search: It is use when the dataset is small or unsorted. It is straightforward and does not require the list to be sorted.
Binary Search: It is use when the dataset is large and sorted. It is much more efficient for larger datasets due to its logarithmic time complexity.
