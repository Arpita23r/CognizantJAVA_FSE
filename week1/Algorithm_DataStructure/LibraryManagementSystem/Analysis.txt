o	Compare the time complexity of linear and binary search.

Linear Search: O(n)
Binary Search: O(log n)

o	Discuss when to use each algorithm based on the data set size and order.

Linear Search: It is use when the dataset is small or unsorted. It is straightforward and does not require the list to be sorted.
Binary Search: It is use when the dataset is large and sorted. It is much more efficient for larger datasets due to its logarithmic time complexity.
