Linear Search:

 Linear search sequentially checks each element in the list until it finds the target value or reaches the end of the list.
Time Complexity: O(n) in the worst case, where n is the number of elements in the list.
Use Case: Useful for small or unsorted datasets.
Binary Search:

 Binary search works on a sorted list by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. If the value of the target is less than the middle element, it narrows the interval to the lower half. Otherwise, it narrows it to the upper half.
Time Complexity: O(log n) in the worst case, where n is the number of elements in the list.
Use Case: Efficient for large, sorted datasets.
