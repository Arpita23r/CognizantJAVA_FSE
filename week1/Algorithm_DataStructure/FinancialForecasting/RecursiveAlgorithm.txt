 Recursion is a technique where a function calls itself in order to solve smaller instances of the same problem. This process continues until it reaches a base case that stops the recursion.

 Recursion can simplify the solution of complex problems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable sub-problems. It is particularly useful for problems that can naturally be divided into similar sub-problems, such as tree traversals, factorial calculation, and Fibonacci sequence generation.
