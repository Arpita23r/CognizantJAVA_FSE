Time Complexity:

The time complexity of the recursive algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of periods. This is because the function calls itself once for each period until it reaches the base case.
Optimizing Recursive Solution:

Memoization: To avoid excessive computation and redundant calculations, memoization can be used. Memoization involves storing the results of expensive function calls and reusing them when the same inputs occur again.

optimize the recursive solution to avoid excessive computation:-
Memoization: By storing previously calculated future values in a map ('memo'), we avoid recalculating values for the same number of periods. This reduces the time complexity to O(n) but with a lower constant factor due to reduced redundant calculations. Memoization is particularly useful in reducing the overhead in recursive functions that involve overlapping subproblems.
