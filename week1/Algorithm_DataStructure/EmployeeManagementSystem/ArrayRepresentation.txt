o	Explain how arrays are represented in memory and their advantages.

Contiguous Memory Allocation: Arrays are stored in contiguous memory locations, which means that each element is located next to the previous one. This allows for efficient access to elements using their index.
Indexing: Arrays allow constant-time access to elements using indices, making it very efficient to retrieve elements.
Fixed Size: The size of an array is fixed at the time of creation, meaning the memory allocated for the array cannot be increased or decreased dynamically.
Advantages of Arrays:

Fast Access: Accessing any element in an array by its index takes O(1) time.
Memory Efficiency: Arrays have a low memory overhead compared to other data structures like linked lists.
Cache Friendliness: Due to contiguous memory allocation, arrays have better cache performance.
