Time Complexity:
Adding a task: O(n) - Inserting a task at the end of the list requires traversing the entire list to find the last node.
Searching for a task: O(n) - Searching for a specific task involves traversing the list until the task is found or the end is reached.
Traversing tasks: O(n) - Traversing the list to print or perform operations on each task requires visiting each node.
Deleting a task: O(n) - Deleting a specific task requires finding the node (or its previous node), which involves traversing the list.
