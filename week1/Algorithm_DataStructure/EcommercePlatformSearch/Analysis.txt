o	Compare the time complexity of linear and binary search algorithms
Time Complexity:
Linear Search:

Best Case: O(1) - The target element is the first element.
Average Case: O(n) - The target element is somewhere in the middle.
Worst Case: O(n) - The target element is the last element or not present.
Binary Search:

Best Case: O(1) - The target element is the middle element.
Average Case: O(log n) - The search interval is repeatedly halved.
Worst Case: O(log n) - The target element is not present, requiring maximum divisions.

o	Discuss which algorithm is more suitable for your platform and why.

For an e-commerce platform, the choice between linear and binary search depends on several factors:

Dataset Size: If the dataset is small, the difference in performance between linear and binary search may be negligible. For larger datasets, binary search is significantly faster.
Frequency of Updates: If products are frequently added or removed, maintaining a sorted array for binary search may be costly. In such cases, linear search might be preferable despite its lower efficiency.
Search Frequency: If search operations are frequent and the dataset is large, binary search is more suitable due to its O(log n) time complexity.
In most cases, binary search would be more suitable for an e-commerce platform, especially if the dataset is large and search operations are frequent. However, if the dataset is dynamic with frequent updates, a different data structure like a balanced binary search tree or a hash table might be considered for optimized search performance.
