Big O Notation
Big O notation is a mathematical notation used to describe the upper bound of an algorithm's runtime or space requirements in terms of the size of the input. It provides a way to express the worst-case scenario in a concise manner, helping to evaluate the efficiency and scalability of an algorithm.

Best, Average, and Worst-Case Scenarios for Search Operations
Best Case: The scenario where the algorithm performs the fewest number of operations. For example, in a search algorithm, the best case occurs when the desired element is the first element in the list.
Average Case: The scenario that represents the expected performance of the algorithm over all possible inputs.
Worst Case: The scenario where the algorithm performs the maximum number of operations. For example, in a search algorithm, the worst case occurs when the desired element is not present in the list or is the last element in the list.
