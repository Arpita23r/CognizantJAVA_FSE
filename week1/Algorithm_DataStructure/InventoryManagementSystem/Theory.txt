Importance of Data Structures and Algorithms in Handling Large Inventories
Efficient data structures and algorithms are essential in managing large inventories because they directly affect the system's performance. Proper data structures ensure that operations such as searching, inserting, updating, and deleting products are performed quickly and efficiently. This efficiency is critical in a warehouse environment where timely access to inventory data can impact operations, order fulfillment, and overall productivity.

Suitable Data Structures for Inventory Management
ArrayList:
 A resizable array that provides fast access and update times. Suitable for scenarios where the inventory size changes frequently but not extremely large.
HashMap:
 Offers average O(1) time complexity for add, update, and delete operations, making it ideal for large inventories where quick access to products by their IDs is necessary.
TreeMap:
 Maintains sorted order of keys, useful if sorted traversal of products is required, but operations have O(log n) time complexity.
